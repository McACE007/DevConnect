## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (v13 or later)

### Run Locally

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devconnect.git
cd devconnect
```

#### 2. Set Up the Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the following:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Set Up the Database

Use Prisma to initialize the database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Generate Prisma Client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

#### 5. Build the App

Compile the TypeScript code:

```bash
npm run build
```

#### 6. Start the App

To start the app in production mode:

```bash
npm start
```

For development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will run on `http://localhost:3001` by default (or the port specified in your `.env` file).
